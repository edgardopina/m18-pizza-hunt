let db; //* this 'global' (for this scope only) variable will hold the db conncection
const dbName = 'pizza_hunt'; //* db to connect or to create if it does not exist
const initialVer = 1; //* db version, used to determine if the db's structure has changed between connections.
//* establish a connection to IndexedDB database; request will act as a listener for the DB when we .open() it
const request = indexedDB.open(dbName, initialVer);

//! This is a listener to handle the event of a change that needs to be made to the database's structure. IndexedDB
//* infers that a change needs to be made when the database is first connected or if the version number changes.
//* This onupgradeneeded event will emit the first time we run the code and create the new_pizza object store.
//* The event won't run again unless we delete the database from the browser or we change the version number in
//* the .open() method to a value of 2, indicating that our database needs an update.
//* When this event executes, we store a locally scoped connection to the database and use the .createObjectStore()
//* method to create the object store that will hold the pizza data. With IndexedDB, we have a veritable blank
//* slateâ€”we'll have to establish all of the rules for working with the database.
//* For that reason, when we create the new_pizza object store, we also instruct that store to have an auto
//* incrementing index for each new set of data we insert. Otherwise we'd have a hard time retrieving data.

   db.createObjectStore('new_pizza', { autoIncrement: true });
};

//! db listener
//* With this first event handler, onsuccess, we set it up so that when we finalize the connection to the database,
//* we can store the resulting database object to the global variable db we created earlier. This event will also
//* emit every time we interact with the database, so every time it runs we check to see if the app is connected
//* to the internet network. If so, we'll execute the uploadPizza() function.
//* upon successful
request.onsuccess = function (event) {

   //* established a connection, save reference to db in global variable
